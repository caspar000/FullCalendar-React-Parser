* Emacs Org-Mode Time Blocking
  Export your Org Agenda files to iCalendar format and visualize the
  information in this Calendar App.

  Before you can use the exported ics files in this app, you need
  to add the following options into you emacs config file.
  
  If you're using *Spacemacs* you have to specify these options
  in the spacemacs configuration file (you can access it by pressing
  ~SPC f e d~) under ~defun dotspacemacs/user-config()~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; The exporter complains if you try to export schedules and deadlines without
     ;; a default duration so we specify it here. The number is in minutes.
     (setq org-agenda-default-appointment-duration 60)
     ;; We have to include the below code otherwise the todo, scheduled, and
     ;; deadline tasks will not be assigned correct information and won't be
     ;; displayed in the ics file I'm sure there is a better way to do this
     ;; but this works for now.
     (setq org-icalendar-include-todo t
           org-icalendar-use-deadline '(event-if-todo event-if-not-todo todo-due)
           org-icalendar-use-scheduled '(event-if-todo event-if-not-todo toto-start)
           org-icalendar-with-timestamps t
           ;; If you want to export all your specified agenda files into a single
           ;; ics file you have to specify a name to it in the config as well.
           ;; Otherwise the exporter won't do anything.
           org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file "combined_agenda.ics")
#+END_SRC

This makes your org agenda files display correct information when
exported using iCalendar format. If you have multiple files you would
export using ~org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files~ instead of
~org-icalendar-export-to-ics~. This will export all your agenda files
and put them into a combined ics file that is called "combined_agenda.ics".
You can change this name to anything you want.
